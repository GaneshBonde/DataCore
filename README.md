# DataCore
This is an open source project to create new SQL Database. The name of the database is DataCore. The database would be faster than any existing database. The database would be using GPU for execution.

The different Language/ Framework for creating this databse are
  1) CUDA
  2) OpenCL
  3) Python(Numba/CuPy)
  4) Metal
  5) HLSL/DirectCompute
  6) GLSL
  7) SYCL

We should be able to run this database on any GPUs provided by different vendors. Also the database should be installable on any OS. As of now OpenCL seems to be a good option.
If there is any other frameworks better than OpenCL. Feel free to create a thread for discussion.
